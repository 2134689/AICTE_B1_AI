**Introduction**
The Mental Health Tracker AI Project is an AI-enabled application designed to track and monitor mental health and well-being. This project aims to provide users with a convenient and supportive tool to assess their mental fitness and identify potential areas of concern. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, the application offers insights into the user's mental health trends and provides personalized recommendations for improvement.

**Project Overview**

The Mental Health Tracker AI Project is built using Python and incorporates various libraries and frameworks for data processing, machine learning, and user interface development. The project follows a supervised learning approach to predict mental health fitness based on user-provided data. It employs the Random Forest Regressor model for making predictions and Gradio for creating a user-friendly web interface.

**Features**

User Input: Users can input their mental health-related data, such as sleep duration, stress levels, physical activity, etc.
AI Predictions: The AI model analyzes the input data and provides a mental health fitness score.
Insights & Recommendations: The application offers personalized insights and recommendations to improve mental well-being.
Interactive Interface: The user interface allows for an intuitive and interactive experience.
